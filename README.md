# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the school district analysis:

The object of this analysis was to show a comparison of passing math and reading scores among various high schools. Grades were separated by grade and by school to determine the passing percentages of all. When the data was reviewed with the board board some concerns were raised that scores from Thomas High School were altered. It was requested that the analysis be repeated with data removed in order to compare it to the original data.


Results:
